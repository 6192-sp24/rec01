These are a couple toy examples based on calculating Fibonacci numbers.

In recitation we may attempt to do a `fibonacci_3` and `fibonacci_4` completely improvised, if time permits, which will give us opportunity to discuss registers of vectors vs. vectors of registers (for fibonacci_3) and BRAM (for fibonacci_4)
